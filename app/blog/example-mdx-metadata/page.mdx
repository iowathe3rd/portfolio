# How to Export Metadata from MDX for Next.js SEO

Next.js supports exporting a `metadata` object from your MDX files, which can be used to enhance SEO and social sharing features. This is especially useful for blog posts and documentation pages.

## Example: Exporting Metadata

You can export a `metadata` object at the top of your MDX file like this:

```javascript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'How to Export Metadata from MDX for Next.js SEO',
  description: 'A guide on exporting metadata from MDX files to leverage Next.js SEO features.',
  authors: [{ name: 'Jane Doe', url: 'https://janedoe.com' }],
  openGraph: {
    images: [
      'https://cdn.cosmos.so/example-image.jpg',
    ],
  },
}
```

This metadata will be picked up by Next.js and can be used for SEO, Open Graph, and other meta tags.

## Why Use Metadata in MDX?

- **SEO**: Improve your page's search engine ranking with relevant titles and descriptions.
- **Social Sharing**: Enhance how your content appears when shared on social media platforms.
- **Consistency**: Keep your metadata close to your content for easier management.
